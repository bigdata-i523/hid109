        Big data refers to data that is generated from various sources including 
        social media platforms. The impact of this data on marketing cannot be 
        overlooked as many marketers have used big data analytics to create adverts
        that are tailored to the specific needs of users. This is possible because 
        whenever a user comments or likes a product on twitter and Facebook, the 
        same information is captured and used to analyze the customer’s behavior. 
        Facebook uses Hadoop technology to help it dig deep into the customer’s 
        behavior and draw important insights which can be used to suggest products 
        for users based on their browsing patterns. This paper will evaluate big data 
        and social media with specific focus on how big data, through social media, 
        has been employed to improve marketing.
