        Big data refers to data that is generated from various sources including 
        social media platforms. The impact of this data on marketing cannot be 
        overlooked as many marketers have used big data analytics to create adverts
        that are tailored to the specific needs of users. This is possible because 
        whenever a user comments or likes a product on twitter and Facebook, the 
        same information is captured and used to analyze the customer’s behavior. 
        Facebook uses Hadoop technology to help it dig deep into the customer’s 
        behavior and draw important insights which can be used to suggest products 
        for users based on their browsing patterns. This paper will evaluate big data 
        and social media with specific focus on how big data, through social media, 
        has been employed to improve marketing.

        This case study evaluates being data application in Amazon, with specific focus
        on how the company has employed big data to enhance its performance. Amazon has 
        created robust applications from big data that has enabled it to give customers 
        more targeted product recommendations and enhance the quality of care for them. 
        The all-rounded customer profiles created using big data resources has enabled 
        the firm to send customized and personalized marketing messages for its customers.
        Other firms have also adopted the big data tools offered by Amazon to enhance 
        their performance and revenue flows. The other parts of the paper evaluates how

        Recently, people tend to use auto play-next while using a cloud-based music app. 
        In this case, content recommendation is at the heart of most subscription-based 
        media stream platforms. A good recommendation system based on a huge number of 
        historical records and metadata can vastly enhance user experience and increase
        user engagement. In our project, we would build machine learning models to predict 
        what songs are going to be listened next week. The training data would be a copy
        of user listening history during a month period and predict what songs a set of 
        predetermined users would listen to during the next week.
